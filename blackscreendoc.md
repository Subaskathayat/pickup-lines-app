If you're diving into Flutter development, you may occasionally encounter frustrating
issues that leave you stumped. One common dilemma many beginners face is finding
that their app, which was functioning perfectly just the day before, suddenly displays
a black screen upon launching. This can be incredibly disheartening, especially when
there are no apparent errors in your code.
In this guide, we will unravel the mystery behind this issue and provide a step-by-step
explanation of how you can solve it effectively.

The Problem: Understanding the Black Screen:
When you see a black screen in your Flutter app, it means the app has been launched
but is not rendering any visible output. This can occur due to various reasons, but one
common culprit is how you initialize and run your app.

Symptoms:
App launches to a black screen.

- No error messages or in Ica Ions o w a wen wrong.
- The code appeared to work perfectly before.
It can be particularly overwhelming for someone who is still learning, as the absence
of error messages may lead to confusion about what went wrong and how to fix it.
The Solution: Running the Correct Widget
The key to resolving the black screen issue lies in ensuring that you are correctly using
the main widget of your app. In the provided code, there's a simple oversight during
the app initialization stage.
Here's How to Fix It
In the initial code, the main function is incorrectly calling MaterialApp directly.
Instead, you should be running your custom widget, MyApp, like this:
void main() {
runApp (const MyApp());
}

Updated Code Example:
Here's how your main function should look after making the change:
void main() {
runApp(const MyApp()) ;
}

Breakdown of the Code Structure:
- Main Function: This is the entry point of your Flutter application. It should call
runApp with your main widget rather than a generic MaterialApp instance.
- Custom Widget: MyApp is where all of your app's Ul building takes place. If it's not
being called correctly, none of the Ul elements will render, resulting in that
dreaded black screen.
