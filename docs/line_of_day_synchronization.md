# Line of the Day Synchronization System

## Overview
The Line of the Day feature has been successfully updated to display all 3 daily pickup lines that are synchronized with the notification system. Users can now view the exact same pickup lines in the app that they receive as notifications throughout the day.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”„ **Perfect Synchronization**
- **Unified Data Source**: Both notifications and the Line of the Day screen use the same `generateDailyLines()` method
- **Consistent Content**: The pickup lines displayed in the app exactly match those sent in notifications
- **Seeded Random Generation**: Uses date-based seeds to ensure consistent daily lines across app sessions

### ðŸ“… **3 Daily Time Slots**
- **Morning Edition (8:00 AM)** ðŸŒ… - "Start Your Day Right"
- **Afternoon Edition (1:00 PM)** ðŸŒž - "Pick-Me-Up" 
- **Evening Edition (7:00 PM)** ðŸŒ™ - "Charm Time"

### ðŸŽ¯ **Current Time Slot Highlighting**
- **Visual Indicators**: Current time slot is highlighted with enhanced styling
- **Border Emphasis**: Active time slot has a colored border and elevated appearance
- **"CURRENT" Badge**: Clear indication of which edition is currently active
- **Dynamic Updates**: Automatically updates as time progresses through the day

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage Structure
```
SharedPreferences Keys:
- morning_line_YYYY-M-D: Morning pickup line for specific date
- morning_category_YYYY-M-D: Category for morning line
- afternoon_line_YYYY-M-D: Afternoon pickup line for specific date
- afternoon_category_YYYY-M-D: Category for afternoon line
- evening_line_YYYY-M-D: Evening pickup line for specific date
- evening_category_YYYY-M-D: Category for evening line
```

### New Service Methods

#### `getAllDailyLines()`
Returns all 3 daily lines with complete metadata:
```dart
List<Map<String, String?>> dailyLines = [
  {
    'line': 'Pickup line text',
    'category': 'Category name',
    'timeSlot': 'Morning',
    'time': '8:00 AM',
    'icon': 'ðŸŒ…',
    'description': 'Start Your Day Right',
  },
  // ... afternoon and evening entries
];
```

#### `getAllDailyLinesWithCurrentHighlight()`
Returns daily lines plus current time slot information:
```dart
Map<String, dynamic> result = {
  'lines': dailyLines,
  'currentTimeSlot': 0, // 0=Morning, 1=Afternoon, 2=Evening
  'currentTimeSlotName': 'Morning',
};
```

### UI Components

#### **Enhanced Screen Layout**
- **Header**: Date display with "Daily Lines" indicator
- **Scrollable List**: All 3 time slots displayed vertically
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Swipe down to refresh content
- **Bottom Info**: Notification schedule and current edition status

### Synchronization Flow

1. **Daily Line Generation**
   ```
   generateDailyLines(date) â†’ Creates 3 unique lines for the date
   â†“
   Stores in SharedPreferences with date-specific keys
   â†“
   Used by both notification scheduling and UI display
   ```

2. **Notification Scheduling**
   ```
   _scheduleNotificationForTimeSlot() â†’ Gets line from generateDailyLines()
   â†“
   Schedules notification with exact line content
   â†“
   Stores notification content for tracking
   ```

3. **UI Display**
   ```
   getAllDailyLines() â†’ Retrieves all 3 lines from storage
   â†“
   Displays in synchronized order with current time highlighting
   â†“
   Updates automatically via pull-to-refresh
   ```
